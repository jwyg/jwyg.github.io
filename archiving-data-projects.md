# Archiving data projects

*A stub for collecting notes about archiving data projects.*

As Niels Brügger comments, “unlike other well-known media, the Internet does not simply exist in a form suited to being archived, but rather is first formed as an object of study in the archiving, and it is formed differently depending on who does the archiving, when, and for what purpose” (Brügger, 2005).

What might one consider in relation to archiving data projects?

Which kinds of data projects? This could include civic tech, open data, data journalism and many others.

Apart from datasets there are also interactive graphics and features, app and mobile libraries, visualisation components, external mapping and API services, and many other things.

There are many different strategies for digital archiving which capture different aspects of projects in different ways, for different purposes - from the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) and national/thematic web archiving projects, to initiatives such as [webrecorder.io](http://webrecorder.io/).
